Problems that are still a thing:

Sometimes cards get discarded when they shouldn't be. Also sometimes if there's only a one in a set, if a one of the same color gets played it still works. Pretty sure both of these happen becasue the counter that gets changed when a card is played (to keep track of the last card in the set) is being updated incorrectly. </p>
