Bugs and current limitations

Sometimes cards get discarded when they shouldn't be. Also sometimes if there's only a one in a set, if a one of the same color gets played it still works. Pretty sure both of these happen becasue the counter that gets changed when a card is played (to keep track of the last card in the set) is being updated incorrectly.

Computer currently makes completely random decision, making for dissatisfying game-play.

Eye tracking is not supported in web version of the game. Current code is set up for use with Tobii Eye-Tracker 4C.
